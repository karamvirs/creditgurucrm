MODULESURFER LICENSE AGREEMENT (BASIC VERSION).


CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BOX, INSTALLING OR USING THE MODULESURFER SOFTWARE
("SOFTWARE"), YOU EXPRESSLY DECLARE TO HAVE READ AND ACCEPTED ALL THE FOLLOWING
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.


1.0 Preamble

1.1 Prerequisites

The Software must be installed in a SugarCRM (TM) working installation
("SugarCRM") whose version and edition are supported by the current release of
the Software.

The Software must be installed in SugarCRM through a free installation tool
("Extension Manager") provided by "Dispage" (defined below), whose license and
privacy informative report ("Privacy Report") are available from the
Documentation area of the Website or upon request made to Email Support.


1.2 Subject of the License

ModuleSurfer is a Software for SugarCRM (TM) customization.

ModuleSurfer has been designed and developed by

Dispage - Patrizio Gelosi
Via A. De Gasperi 91 
P. Potenza Picena (MC) - Italy

(Hereby referred to as "Dispage").

Copyright (c) 2010-2012 Dispage.

The Software is identified by the following resources ("Resources"):
a) All the files that are copied into the SugarCRM directory ("SugarCRM
Directory") or its sub-directories during the process of installation
("Installation Process") of the Software.
b) All the parts of code that are added to existing SugarCRM files during the
Installation Process.

Hereby, file and directory paths are to be intended as paths relative to the
SugarCRM Directory path. 
Resources may belong to two categories:
(i) "Encrypted Files": files under the path
'custom/include/ModuleSurfer/ListView/v3o/'
(ii) "Plain Code": all Resources not belonging to the category in the point (i)

The terms of this agreement apply to the Resources of category (i) and (ii)
present in the SugarCRM Directory after the Software installation. Additionally,
they apply to all the Software files that may be stored into paths different
from the SugarCRM Directory (including, as non-exhaustive examples, the
temporary directory where the files are stored after the download and the
'cache/upload/upgrades/temp' directory) during the download, the Installation
Process or the subsequent operation of SugarCRM application. In the case of
Software files stored in different paths, the path location in the point (i)
above is to be intended as path relative to the directory where the files are
stored; in the case that Software files are compressed in an archive file, the
path location refers to the relative path of the files compressed in the archive
file.

The Encrypted Files contain encrypted PHP code that is essential to the Software
key features. Encrypted Files are subject to the additional restrictions
indicated in Section 2.2 and need decryption keys ("Decryption Keys") to be
correctly interpreted and to activate all the Software functionalities.

Decryption Keys are automatically and silently downloaded by Extension Manager
from the Website ("Key Refresh") each time a SugarCRM User ("SugarCRM User") log
in SugarCRM. If for any reason the Key Refresh process fails, Encrypted Files
are correctly decrypted still for the subsequent five (5) days since Decryption
Keys are automatically stored in dispage cache directory.

IMPORTANT: Key Refresh is one of the above-mentioned Website Services and is
subject to the limitations indicated in Section 3.2 .
